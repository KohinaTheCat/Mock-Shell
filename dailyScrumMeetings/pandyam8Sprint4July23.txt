What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added cp and rm commands
    - Made changes to error check and parser methods so that they accept the cp
      and rm commands
    - Decided redesigns based on feedback.
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Start Sprint5 tasks
	- finish the recursion for copying directories

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
