What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished task a: Ensured the Cat command either prints the error or the contents
    of the file, when the given argument is a list of file names
    - Finished task b: Had -R be a recognized argument, and Ls now prints contents of sub-directories
    recursively
    - Finished task c

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Implement the Tree class
    - Start creating JUnit Tests

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
