What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished Pushd Class
    - Made a master command class, such that every command class inherits from it
    - Made changes to the Parser class, so that it correctly calls the commands correctly
    - Made changes to the sub-command classes so they now check their own arguments for validity
    - Made sure design matches new CRC card implementations

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - JavaDoc Comments
    - Testing and Debugging

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
